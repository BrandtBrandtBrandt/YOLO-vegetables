# YOLO-vegetables

This is a small personal project where I trained a YOLO model on a custom dataset of vegetables. The goal was to explore object detection in a specialized context, using custom-labeled data.

Overview

	•	Dataset: The dataset consists of various vegetable images, annotated using Roboflow for labeling and preprocessing.
	•	Model: YOLO (You Only Look Once) was selected as the object detection model for its speed and performance.
	•	Training: The model was trained using Google Colab to take advantage of its free GPU resources.

Steps

	1.	Data Collection: Gathered images of vegetables and organized them into a dataset.
	2.	Annotation: Used Roboflow to annotate and prepare the data for YOLO training.
	3.	Model Training: Trained the YOLO model in Google Colab, utilizing GPU acceleration for faster training times.
